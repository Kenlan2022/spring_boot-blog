## General Improvements & Future Tasks

This list contains potential improvements and features for the future.

### Core Functionality
- **Add Integration Tests**: Implement integration tests for `PostController` to validate API endpoints.
- **Add User Service**: Create a new `user-service` to manage user data, separate from Keycloak.
- **Add Comments Feature**: Allow users to add comments to blog posts.
- **Add Search Functionality**: Enable users to search for blog posts by keywords.
- **Implement Pagination**: Add pagination for listing blog posts. (Partially done, can be improved).

### Architecture & Infrastructure
- **Set Up CI/CD Pipeline**: Create a basic CI/CD pipeline to automate builds, tests, and deployments.
- **Centralize Configuration**: Move service configurations to a centralized config server (e.g., Spring Cloud Config).
- **Enhance Logging**: Implement structured logging (e.g., with Logstash or Fluentd) for better monitoring and debugging.
- **Add API Gateway**: Introduce an API Gateway (e.g., Spring Cloud Gateway) to manage and route API requests.
- **Set Up Monitoring**: Integrate Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring service health and performance.
- **Implement Distributed Tracing**: Use Micrometer Tracing (formerly Spring Cloud Sleuth) with Zipkin or Jaeger to trace requests across microservices.

### Security
- **Refine Security Rules**: Enhance `SecurityConfig` to apply more granular access controls based on user roles.
- **Implement User Roles**: Introduce different user roles (e.g., admin, author, reader) with varying permissions.

### Frontend
- **Implement Frontend**: Develop a simple frontend application (e.g., using React or Vue) to interact with the blog service.
